Pyq istallation is more involved than that of pyk because q is not
available as a shared library.  In order to overcome this limitation
pyq requires a python dynamic library that is loaded into the q
interpreter.  This is "tail waging the dog" approach given that
currently pyq does not support calling python from q, only q from
python.

Prerequisites:

1. Q (http://kxdownloads.com)
2. Python 2.4 or later, built using --enable-shared option.
3. GNU make, gcc

On a linux system, running "python setup.py install" will install
necessary python and q modules. On other systems installation of q
modules will probably break. For manual installation, compile _k.c
as a python module, py.c as a q module and copy files as follows:

  py.so -> QHOME/OS
  python.q -> QHOME
  _k.so, q.py -> PYTHONPATH
